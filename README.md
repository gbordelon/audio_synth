# audio_synth
Currently the synth supports a simple testing instrument I created and a subset of six-operator algorithms for a synth based on the DX7.

The synth can also be ignored and a stereo line-in can be used.

In addition, there are many effects implemented based on the book Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++ by Pirkle. I can apply these effects to a synth or to my guiter via the line-in.

The included python script is intended to be used as a MIDI controller for testing the synth.
